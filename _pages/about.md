Hey! I am a second-year doctoral student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I am interested in how we can support humans in better understanding large datasets to extract meaningful insights. More specifically, I am looking at how domain experts can be supported in understanding complex datasets in-depth to enable them to refine datasets and, subsequently improve their decisions in the context of human-AI collaboration.
