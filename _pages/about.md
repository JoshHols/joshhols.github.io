Hey! I am a fourth-year doctoral student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. My research focuses on improving human-AI collaboration for decision-making by looking at the underlying mental model that shape this collaboration. More specifically, I investigate how we can design AI systems that help humans make better decisions by contextualizing the underlying data through understanding and communicating uncertainty, providing appropriate explanations, and aligning incentives between humans and AI. My work combines behavioral experiments with design science approaches to develop frameworks and design principles that enhance collaborative decision-making while avoiding pitfalls like overreliance and misinformation effects. If you are interested in my research or think we could collaborate, I am happy if you reach out!
